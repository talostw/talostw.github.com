We use Google Sheets to collect data by working with the indigenous communities (field work). This means we meet with the indigenous community councils and language teachers and organize events to educate the indigenous volunteers how to collect (type) language data and fill it into the Google Sheets we prepare. We also travel to the villages and introduce open source software, e.g. EzGo, and help to install the operating system onto their computers. We later package the data and upload it to Debian and EzGo, so that the indigenous population can actually use the tools we develop on their own computers.

If you feel you want to promote FOSS to the indigenous population and are willing to travel to their villages and participate in their community events, please let us know.

If you feel you want to guide the indigenous volunteers in how to input the language data into the Google Sheets, and later help to cross check and correct typing mistakes, please contact us as well.
